A minecraft terminator plugin that I use to play with my friends

Based on GeorgeNotFound's original plugin, and I made my own improvements on it.

Remember to set the player render distance to 96 blocks before you use, and to enable flight on the server to prevent the terminator from constantly being kicked.

Intended to be used with the "terminator" on kill aura and using baritone to chase players. 

The terminator's perks:
- Will teleport towards players if they become too far out of reach
  - Will also jump dimensions if all players have left their current dimension, and will also subsequently die to prevent surprise teleportation attacks
- Takes halved damage from all sources, and 90% reduction from lava, suffocation, drowning, and fall damage
- Takes no damage if farther than 40 blocks from any players
- When killed, freezes in place for 30 seconds. 
- Tools take no durability and they cannot consume blocks or food
- Cannot pick up items

Miscellaneous changes to make the game easier to beat:
- Compasses allow you to teleport to other players
- Enderman now always drop one additional pearl
